# ncryptd

NcryptD is an encryption/decryption software solution based on Alan Turing's Bombe Computer and the German Enigma Machine used in WWII.

This project is an attempt to fix the Enigma Machine by adding simple modern encryption methods. Alan Turing was able to crack the code and build his Bombe Computer by exploiting the fact that the enigma machine could never encode a letter as itself.

You can run the 'enigmaSim.pde' file for a simulated experience.
Note - you need processing 3 or 4 to run this file.
